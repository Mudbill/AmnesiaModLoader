October 1st 2016 - version 1.6.3 - Windows

- Added this update window to show up with a changelog when running after last boot was a different version.
- Fixed launching mods using the Steam version of Amnesia. Now requires that you tick the "Use Steam" box in the options.
- Rearranged preferences (options) to reflect the Mac version.
  - This includes an "Advanced" page which includes a few more settings and warnings.
- Added ability to check online for a newer update and then link to the forum post.
  - I might add some auto-update installation in the future, but for now it only checks and prompts.
- Organized a lot of the internal code to hopefully be easier to update/manage in the future.
- Miscellaneous tweaks and bugfixes.
