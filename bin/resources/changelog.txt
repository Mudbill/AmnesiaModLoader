October 23rd 2016 - version 1.6.5 - Windows

- Added option to create a Windows shortcut to a mod to start it even quicker, in case you launch it a lot.
- Removed ability to patch config (since FG updated Amnesia to fix this).
- Moved "Use Steam" to advanced page since it's no longer important (also fixed by FG)
- Moved "Apply shaders" to advanced page since it doesn't need to be in your face.

October 10th 2016 - version 1.6.4 - Windows

- Fixed issue with update crashing the app while offline.
- Added more multi-threading so that the app works a bit smoother.
- Greatly improved scanning speed.
- Added field below mod list to display scan progress/currently selected mod.
- Added proposed default directory for first-time start.
- Changed mod list font from "System" to "Consolas".

October 1st 2016 - version 1.6.3 - Windows

- Added this update window to show up with a changelog when running after last boot was a different version.
- Fixed launching mods using the Steam version of Amnesia. Now requires that you tick the "Use Steam" box in the options.
- Rearranged preferences (options) to reflect the Mac version.
  - This includes an "Advanced" page which includes a few more settings and warnings.
- Added ability to check online for a newer update and then link to the forum post.
  - I might add some auto-update installation in the future, but for now it only checks and prompts.

- Miscellaneous tweaks and bugfixes.
